        <p>
            I have been a project coordinator for the last 7 years with my current company, I recently became bored with this position as I feel as though I have mastered it. For the last 2 years I have been looking
            for a change but wasn't sure what would be the best option for me. I knew I didnt want to enroll in a 2 or 4 year college degree program but wanted to have a meaningful job that I enjoyed. I went back
            and fourth on what I wanted to do from project management to Data Analysis but neither of them peaked my interest. Scrollling through an add on social media I came across coding and full stack web developemnt. I 
            researched web development and software engineering for hours. I would get so lost and that's all I wanted to do. I became so intrigued and interested in web development. I made a promise to myself that by my 33rd 
            birthday I would have a solid plan to change my career path. I would have it all figured out by then. I began self teaching myself through courses on youtube, udemy, and free code camp. I searched for hours for the most 
            affordable bootcamps until I stumbled upon Georgia tech full stack bootcamp. I took the leap and signed up and here I am today.
